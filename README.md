I’ve made some UI adjustments and added a Snackbar that appears when there’s a network communication issue.

Hi, 
  This is my first .NET MAUI project — just a small demo I built to practice working with REST APIs.

  I started learning to code about a year ago, beginning with Java. Just recently — about a month ago — I began exploring C# and .NET MAUI, so I’m still very new to both.

  Built this demo on 8 May 2025. It took me around seven hours to complete — coding and learning as I went. I got help from AI (ChatGPT and Gemini) and I also referred to Microsoft’s official MAUI documentation: <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui?view=net-maui-9.0

  And watch Gerald Versluis’s YouTube video:<br> https://www.youtube.com/@jfversluis  

  I think MAUI is a really powerful framework. Whether it’s the right choice for most commercial projects is a separate discussion — but personally, I’m really interested in it. It feels like a big step toward the ideal of “Write once, Run anywhere.”(Yes ,this’s Java’s slogan.) So I’m well-willed to keep learning more about it.

IDE:Rider（MacOS（arm））<br>sdk version: 8.0.408

May God bless your work and learning.
